I've been coming on and off about creating my own blog since I was in high school. But I never really committed to it. It's probably because it took me too long to customize the site as I was having too much fun with CSS. Or because eventually I realized it was far from my comfort zone to publicize my (queer) thoughts. Or I was just really suck in putting stuff into words. I'm sure it's one of those.

So why now? Thing is, as I grew older, I realized I've encountered at least 20 moments in my life that are very lesson-loaded/educational and paramount to my life/career progression. And I've never thought for one second to archive them somewhere for future use. Exhibit A: a couple of days ago, I invested some significant minutes on how to properly change kernel header on Ubuntu 14.04. If somehow I need to do the same thing again, I'd have been as clueless as I was the first time because I didn't write it down.

Thus, this will be a perfect medium for me to dump and digitally memorialize all of those precious knowledge. The plan is to document any useful tips/hacks/ideas/how-tos that pertain to the betterment of my life/career. Although I'm pretty sure 80% of the writings will probably be of some nerdy way to color-code my emacs or ramblings about how painful debugging in kernel space is - but we'll see how it takes off from here. If this turns out to be an e-tabloid or whatever siakapkeli is then we know when to stop.
